# Hi ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Tommy, I'm a 4th Year Computer Science Student at Imperial

- My biggest personal project is [Unigrade](https://github.com/Uni-Grade), an ios App to help students keep track of their grades avaliable from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tt/app/unigrade/id1605243513) currently with several thousand downloads :)
- Here is an interesting project I've worked on: [Designging Sounds](https://github.com/designing-sounds/designing_sounds) where users can draw waveforms and play with them in real time to make interesting sounds and noises.
