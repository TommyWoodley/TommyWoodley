# Hi ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Tommy, I'm a 4th Year Computer Science Student at Imperial

- My biggest personal project is [Unigrade](https://github.com/Uni-Grade), an ios App to help students keep track of their grades available from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tt/app/unigrade/id1605243513) currently with over 20K downloads :)
- My master's project is based on using Reinforcement Learning for Agile Trajectory Generation for Tensile Perching with Aerial Robots. As part of this, I created the first end-to-end tethered perching simulation environment. Utilised demonstration data with training. Applied this in practice with real demonstration environments. [Main Repository](https://github.com/TommyWoodley/TommyWoodleyMEngProject) [Flight Controller](https://github.com/TommyWoodley/ROS2_PX4_Offboard_Perching_Drone)
- Here is an interesting project I've worked on: [Designging Sounds](https://github.com/designing-sounds/designing_sounds) where users can draw waveforms and play with them in real time to make interesting sounds and noises.

- I'm a Software Engineer at Cisco in the DLP team.
